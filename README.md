How to use `goto`: <br>
source ~/goto.sh <br>
alias goto-add="sh ~/goto-add.sh" <br>
Notes: A reload of bash is needed each time a shortcut is added, because .bashrc needs to source it again.<br><br>

Purpose of `vpn-on` and `vpn-off`: <br>
Randomised VPN selection so I don't have to manually chose what country to go to. Why? Lazy I guess, also its fun to see where I end up.
