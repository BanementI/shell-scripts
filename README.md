# shell-scripts
Scripts that improves my Arch user experience

`goto`: <br>
source ~/goto.sh <br>
alias goto-add="sh ~/goto-add.sh" <br>
Notes: A reload of bash is needed each time a shortcut is added, because .bashrc needs to source it again.<br><br>

`vpn-on` / `vpn-off`: <br>
Randomised VPN selection so I don't have to manually chose what country to go to. Why? Lazy I guess, also its fun to see where I end up. <br>

`0x0-wsl`: <br>
Little menu thing that lets me decide which 0x0 instance I want to upload a file to. Meant for WSL with System32 in your path. <br>

`0x0`: <br>
Ditto, but for Linux.<br>
